## Features

- Simple configuration.
- Batteries included experience.
- No timer. Update immediately as changes happen.

## Limitations

- No fancy colors. The colors of the entire statusline itself depend on your color scheme.
- No fancy separators. Components are separated by whitespace.

## Requirements

- Works on Neovim 0.10.1. Not tested on other versions.

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager. For example, [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "hernancerm/bareline.nvim",
  opts = {}
},
```

The function `require("barelilne").setup()` needs to be called for Bareline to draw the statusline.
Lazy.nvim does this automatically using the snippet above.

## Default config

```lua
{
  statuslines = {
    -- Active window.
    active = {
      { -- Section 1: Left.
        bareline.components.vim_mode,
        bareline.components.file_path_relative_to_cwd,
        bareline.components.lsp_servers,
        "%m", "%h", "%r",
      },
      { -- Section 2: Right.
        bareline.components.diagnostics,
        bareline.components.indent_style,
        bareline.components.end_of_line,
        bareline.components.git_head,
        bareline.components.position,
      },
    },
    -- Inactive windows.
    inactive = {
      { -- Section 1: Left.
        bareline.components.vim_mode:mask(" "),
        bareline.components.file_path_relative_to_cwd,
        bareline.components.lsp_servers,
        "%m", "%h", "%r",
      },
      { -- Section 2: Right.
        bareline.components.diagnostics,
        bareline.components.indent_style,
        bareline.components.end_of_line,
        bareline.components.position,
      },
    },
    -- Plugin windows.
    plugin = {
      { -- Section 1: Left.
        bareline.components.plugin_name,
        "%m"
      },
      { -- Section 2: Right.
        bareline.components.position
      },
    },
  }
}
```
