# Developing Bareline

## Vim help file

- The Vim help file [bareline.txt](./doc/bareline.txt) is generated from the plugin file
  [bareline.lua](./lua/bareline.lua) using
  [mini.doc](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-doc.md). Ensure you
  have installed mini.doc in your Neovim, then execute the following in the bareline project: `:lua
  MiniDoc.generate()`. This uses the configuration in [minidoc.lua](./scripts/minidoc.lua) to
  generate the help file.
- Recommended format options to facilitate proper hard wrapping:
```lua
-- Set default formatting options.
vim.o.formatoptions = "tcqjrn"
-- Improve pattern recognition for lists.
vim.o.formatlistpat = [[^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*\|\s*[-*â€¢]\s*]]
```
- Throughout [bareline.lua](./lua/bareline.lua), comments beginning with `DOCS:` indicate something
  important to convey on user-facing documentation. When modifying sections close to these comments,
  honor them.

## Development guidelines

Lua:
- Every identifier is named in snake_case, except classes which use PascalCase.
- The identifier `h` holds helper functions and values, not meant to be made public.

## Tips

- The entire plugin is in the single file [bareline.lua](./lua/bareline.lua). This is so the Vim
  help file is simpler to generate. To navigate the file, consider populating the location list
  using the below EX command. This works since each part of the code is separated by comments with
  all caps, e.g., `-- COMPONENTS`.

```
lgrep '^-- [A-Z:\s]+$' %
```
